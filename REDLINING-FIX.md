# üé® Red-Lining Fix - Proper Word Document Generation

## Issue Resolved

**Problem:** AI was generating plain text files with `[ADD]` and `[DELETE]` tags instead of proper Word documents with track changes formatting.

**Solution:** Implemented proper `.docx` generation with:
- ‚úÖ Red strikethrough for deletions
- ‚úÖ Yellow highlighting for additions
- ‚úÖ Proper Microsoft Word format

---

## What Changed

### 1. **New Word Document Generator**
Created `/services/ai-review/src/docx-generator.ts`

- Uses the `docx` npm library
- Parses AI corrections with `[ADD]`/`[DELETE]` tags
- Converts to proper Word formatting:
  - **Deletions:** Red text with strikethrough
  - **Additions:** Yellow background highlighting
  - **Regular text:** No special formatting

### 2. **Updated AI Review Service**
Modified `/services/ai-review/index.ts`

- Changed from saving `.txt` files to `.docx` files
- Draft filename: `sub_XXXXX-draft.docx` (was `.txt`)
- Calls `generateRedlinedDocx()` to create properly formatted documents
- Falls back to text file if Word generation fails

### 3. **Fixed Dashboard Downloads**
Updated `/services/dashboard/index.ts`

- Fixed file path resolution for downloads
- Properly handles `.docx` extension in download filenames
- Downloads now work with correct MIME types

## Alignment with RSH Guidelines

Following the RSH Menu Submission Guidelines (see `/samples/RSH_Menu Submission Guidelines_2025[96] (1).pdf`):

‚úÖ **Red-lining for corrections**
‚úÖ **Yellow highlighting for important changes**
‚úÖ **Professional Word document format**
‚úÖ **Compatible with Microsoft Word track changes workflow**

---

## Known Limitations & Future Improvements

### Current Limitations:
1. **Not True Track Changes**: Uses formatting (strikethrough/highlight) rather than Word's native track changes API
   - **Why:** `docx` library doesn't fully support track changes API yet
   - **Impact:** Visual appearance is correct, but not using Word's revision system

2. **Paragraph Grouping**: Complex multi-line changes may not group perfectly
   - Working on improved paragraph detection

### Planned Improvements:
- [ ] Implement true Word track changes when library supports it
- [ ] Add change author/timestamp metadata
- [ ] Improve paragraph/section detection
- [ ] Add comments for complex corrections

## Troubleshooting

### Dashboard Shows "Word experienced an error"

**Cause:** Trying to open from the browser, which may not handle the absolute path correctly.

**Solution:** Click the download icon to save the file locally first, then open from your Downloads folder.

### File Won't Download

**Check:**
1. Is the service running? `curl http://localhost:3005`
2. Check logs: `tail -f logs/dashboard.log`
3. Verify file exists: `ls -lh tmp/ai-drafts/`

### Word Document Opens But No Formatting

**Possible Causes:**
1. Using Google Docs (doesn't support all Word features)
2. Using older version of Word
3. Document got converted to text during download

**Solution:** Use Microsoft Word 2007 or newer on desktop
