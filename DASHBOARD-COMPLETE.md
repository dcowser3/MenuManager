    # Dashboard & Differ Services - Implementation Complete! 🎉

## What Was Built

While you're waiting for Azure access, I've completed the dashboard and differ (AI learning) services that complete your workflow.

### New Services Created

#### 1. **Dashboard Service** (`port 3005`)
**Location**: `services/dashboard/`

**Features**:
- ✅ Web interface for reviewing submissions

- ✅ Compares AI draft vs final human-approved version
- ✅ Calculates change percentage
- ✅ Logs differences for AI learning
- ✅ Creates training dataset
- ✅ Provides statistics API

**Files Created**:
- `index.ts` - Document comparison service
- `package.json` - Dependencies

**Training Data**:
- Saved to: `tmp/learning/training_data.jsonl`
- One JSON entry per approval
- Tracks what changes reviewers make

### Updated Services

#### Database Service
**Added endpoints**:
- `GET /submissions/:id` - Get single submission
- `GET /submissions/pending` - Get all pending reviews

#### Notifier Service
**Enhanced email**:
- Beautiful HTML email template
- Direct link to dashboard review page
- Submission details
- Clear call-to-action button

### Updated Scripts

#### `start-services.sh`
- Now starts dashboard (port 3005)
- Now starts differ (port 3006)
- Shows dashboard URL when starting

#### `stop-services.sh`
- Stops all 7 services including new ones

#### `view-logs.sh`
- Added dashboard logs
- Added differ logs

## Complete Workflow

```
EMAIL → AI DRAFT → DASHBOARD → HUMAN REVIEW → DIFFER LEARNING → CHEF
```

### Step-by-Step

1. **Email Arrives**
   - Chef sends menu to `designapproval@richardsandoval.com`
   - You move it to "Menu Submissions" folder

2. **AI Processing**
   - Template validated
   - Tier 1 review (QA check)
   - Tier 2 review (generates draft)
   - Status: `pending_human_review`

3. **Email Notification**
   - Internal reviewer gets email
   - **Contains direct link to dashboard**
   - Example: `http://localhost:3005/review/sub_1234567890`

4. **Dashboard Review**
   - Reviewer clicks link
   - Downloads original & AI draft
   - Compares documents in Word

5. **Approval Decision**

   **Option A - Quick Approve**:
   ```
   AI draft is perfect!
   → Click "Approve & Send to Chef"
   → Uses AI draft as final version
   → Differ logs: no changes made
   → Chef receives AI draft
   ```

   **Option B - Upload Corrections**:
   ```
   Made additional edits
   → Upload corrected .docx file
   → Click "Upload & Send to Chef"
   → Uses YOUR version as final
   → Differ compares AI vs yours
   → Chef receives YOUR version
   → AI learns from differences
   ```

6. **Differ Analysis**
   - Automatically triggered after approval
   - Compares AI draft with final version
   - Calculates change percentage
   - Saves training data

7. **Chef Notification**
   - Email sent with final document
   - Professional formatting
   - Approved and ready to use

## How to Test It

### Prerequisites
```bash
# Build the new services
npm install
npm run build --workspaces
```

### Start Everything
```bash
./start-services.sh

# You'll see:
# ✅ All services started!
# 📊 Dashboard: http://localhost:3005
```

### Simulate a Review

```bash
# 1. Create a test submission in DB
curl -X POST http://localhost:3004/submissions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "submitter_email": "test@example.com",
    "filename": "test_menu.docx",
    "original_path": "/tmp/test.docx",
    "status": "pending_human_review",
    "ai_draft_path": "/tmp/test-draft.txt"
  }'

# 2. Open dashboard
open http://localhost:3005

# 3. You should see the test submission
# 4. Click "Review Now"
# 5. Try both approval paths
```

## Email Link Integration

### How It Works

When AI finishes processing, the notifier sends:

**Email**:
```
Subject: 🔔 New Menu Submission for Review: Fall_Menu.docx

[Beautiful HTML email with gradient header]

Submission ID: sub_1234567890
Filename: Fall_Menu.docx
Submitter: chef@restaurant.com

[📊 Review Now →] ← Clickable button

Direct URL: http://localhost:3005/review/sub_1234567890
```

### Configuration

In `.env`:
```bash
# Dashboard URL for email links
DASHBOARD_URL=http://localhost:3005

# For production, change to:
# DASHBOARD_URL=https://dashboard.yourdomain.com
```

## AI Learning System

### What Gets Tracked

Every approval creates a training entry:

```json
{
  "submission_id": "sub_1234567890",
  "timestamp": "2024-10-18T10:30:00Z",
  "ai_draft_length": 5420,
  "final_length": 5450,
  "changes_detected": true,
  "change_percentage": 0.55,
  "ai_draft_path": "tmp/ai-drafts/sub_1234567890-draft.txt",
  "final_path": "tmp/finals/sub_1234567890-final.docx",
  "analysis": {
    "identical": false,
    "ai_draft_words": 892,
    "final_words": 895,
    "word_count_diff": 3,
    "character_count_diff": 30
  }
}
```

### View Statistics

```bash
# Get training stats
curl http://localhost:3006/stats

Response:
{
  "total_comparisons": 25,
  "comparisons_with_changes": 8,
  "comparisons_without_changes": 17,
  "average_change_percentage": 2.4
}
```

This shows: **68% of the time, AI draft is perfect!**
