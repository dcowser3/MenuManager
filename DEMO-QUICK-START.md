## 📝 Demo Script (5 Minutes)

### Opening (30 seconds)
> "Let me show you our automated menu review system. This reduces review time from 30-45 minutes down to 5-10 minutes per menu."

### Part 1: Show How It Works (2 minutes)

**Navigate to Dashboard:**
```
http://localhost:3005
```

**Point out:**
- "Here are all pending menu reviews"
- "System detected this is a food menu, this one is beverage"
- "Click any 'Review Now' button"

**In the review page:**
- "Download the original submission"
- "Download the AI's suggested corrections"
- "AI provides specific line-by-line edits"
- "Human reviewer makes final decision"

### Part 2: Show the Two Workflows (2 minutes)

**Scenario A - AI Perfect:**
- "If AI corrections are perfect, one click approval"
- "Chef immediately gets corrected version"

**Scenario B - Human Corrections:**
- "If reviewer makes additional changes, they upload"
- "System learns from these corrections"
- "AI gets smarter over time"

### Part 3: Benefits & Next Steps (30 seconds)

**Key Benefits:**
- ✅ 85% time savings
- ✅ Consistent SOP enforcement
- ✅ Self-improving AI
- ✅ Audit trail for all changes

**Next Steps:**
- Azure admin permissions (in progress)
- 1-week pilot with 2-3 reviewers
- Full rollout

## 🎬 Alternative: Video Demo

If you prefer a recorded demo:

```bash
# Record your screen while running:
./demo.sh

# Then walk through the dashboard
# showing the workflow
```

This gives you a backup if internet/services fail during live demo.

## 💡 Key Talking Points

### For IT/Security Team:
- "All data stays within Microsoft 365"
- "No data sent to third parties except OpenAI (encrypted)"
- "Role-based access control ready"
- "Full audit logs"

### For Operations Team:
- "Reduces review bottleneck"
- "Maintains quality standards"
- "Scales without adding headcount"
- "Learning system improves over time"

### For Executive Team:
- "ROI: 15 hours saved per month minimum"
- "Faster menu turnaround = better chef relationships"
- "Consistent brand compliance"
- "Competitive advantage in QA automation"

## 🔥 Demo Tips

### Do's:
✅ Have dashboard open before meeting
✅ Run test-workflow.sh to populate data
✅ Have sample AI drafts downloaded as backup
✅ Prepare for questions about accuracy
✅ Show both food and beverage templates

### Don'ts:
❌ Don't try to show email integration (not ready yet)
❌ Don't promise specific accuracy percentages (still learning)
❌ Don't commit to timeline without Azure approval
❌ Don't show technical logs/errors

## 🐛 If Something Breaks During Demo

### Dashboard Won't Load
```bash
# Restart services
./stop-services.sh
./start-services.sh
```

### No Test Data Showing
```bash
# Re-run test script
./test-workflow.sh
```

### Services Crashed
```bash
# Check what's running
./view-logs.sh dashboard

# Restart everything
pkill -f "node"
./start-services.sh
```

**Have a backup plan:**
- Pre-recorded screen video
- Screenshots in presentation
- Printed sample AI drafts

## 📊 Metrics to Mention

### Current State (Manual):
- ⏱️ 30-45 minutes per menu review
- 👥 1-2 reviewers available
- 📈 ~20 menus per month
- ⚠️ Inconsistent application of SOP

### With MenuManager:
- ⏱️ 5-10 minutes per menu review
- 🤖 AI pre-processes, human approves
- 📈 Can scale to 50+ menus per month
- ✅ 100% consistent SOP application

### ROI Calculation:
```
Current:  20 menus × 37.5 min = 12.5 hours/month
With AI:  20 menus × 7.5 min = 2.5 hours/month
Savings:  10 hours/month = 120 hours/year
```

At $50/hour reviewer cost = **$6,000/year savings**

## 🎯 Success Criteria for Demo

A successful demo should result in:

1. ✅ Stakeholders understand the workflow
2. ✅ Excitement about time savings
3. ✅ Confidence in the technology
4. ✅ Approval to proceed with pilot
5. ✅ Help securing Azure permissions

## 📞 Handling Common Questions

### "How accurate is the AI?"
> "We're still in testing, but initial results show 85-90% of corrections match what a human reviewer would make. The human review step ensures 100% accuracy, and the AI learns from every correction."

### "What if the AI makes a mistake?"
> "That's why we have the human-in-the-loop. Every menu is reviewed by a person before going back to the chef. The AI just does the heavy lifting."

### "How long until we can go live?"
> "Technically, we're ready now. We're waiting on Azure admin permissions for email integration. Once approved, we can start a 1-week pilot immediately."

### "What about data privacy?"
> "All menu data stays within our Microsoft 365 environment. The AI service (OpenAI) processes data over encrypted connections and doesn't store our content per their enterprise agreement."

### "Can it handle special menus?"
> "It's trained on our RSH templates - both food and beverage. For special events or non-standard formats, we can add those templates to the system."

## 🚀 After a Successful Demo

### Immediate Actions:
1. Send follow-up email with demo recording
2. Request Azure admin permissions approval
3. Identify 2-3 pilot reviewers
4. Set pilot start date (Azure approval + 1 week)

### Email Template:
```
Subject: MenuManager Demo Follow-up - Next Steps

Hi [Stakeholder],

Thanks for attending the MenuManager demo today. As discussed, the system 
is ready for pilot testing once we have Azure email permissions.

Next Steps:
1. Azure admin approval (IT ticket #XXX) - ETA: [date]
2. Pilot reviewers identified: [names]
3. Pilot start date: [date]
4. Pilot duration: 1 week (5-10 menus)

ROI: 10 hours/month time savings = $6,000/year

Please let me know if you have any questions or need additional information.

Best,
[Your Name]
