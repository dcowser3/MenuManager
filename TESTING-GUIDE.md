# üß™ Testing Guide - MenuManager

This guide will help you test and demonstrate the MenuManager system **without** connecting to live email yet.

## üéØ Purpose

Test the complete menu review workflow locally to:
- ‚úÖ Validate all components work correctly
- ‚úÖ Demonstrate to stakeholders before going live
- ‚úÖ Ensure AI review accuracy
- ‚úÖ Test the human review dashboard
- ‚úÖ Verify the learning feedback loop

---

## üìã Prerequisites

### 1. Install Dependencies
```bash
npm install --workspaces
npm run build --workspaces
```

### 2. Configure Environment Variables
Edit `.env` file and set at minimum:
```bash
# Required for testing
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-api-key-here

# Optional for testing (use defaults)
DB_SERVICE_URL=http://localhost:3004
PARSER_SERVICE_URL=http://localhost:3001
AI_REVIEW_SERVICE_URL=http://localhost:3002
NOTIFIER_SERVICE_URL=http://localhost:3003
DASHBOARD_URL=http://localhost:3005
```

**Note:** Azure credentials are NOT needed for local testing.

## üöÄ Quick Start - Automated Test

### Run the Complete Test Suite

```bash
# 1. Start all services
./start-services.sh

# 2. Run automated workflow test
./test-workflow.sh
```

This will:
1. ‚úÖ Verify all services are running
2. ‚úÖ Submit test menu documents (food & beverage)
3. ‚úÖ Validate template detection
4. ‚úÖ Simulate AI review process
5. ‚úÖ Create mock review drafts
6. ‚úÖ Open the dashboard for human review
7. ‚úÖ Display test summary and demo talking points

## üî¨ Manual Testing - Step by Step

### Test 1: Parser & Template Validation

Test that the parser correctly validates menu templates.

```bash
# Test Food Menu Template
curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/parser \
  -F "file=@samples/RSH_DESIGN BRIEF_FOOD_Menu_Template .docx" \
  -F "submitter_email=chef@test-restaurant.com"

# Test Beverage Menu Template
curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/parser \
  -F "file=@samples/RSH Design Brief Beverage Template.docx" \
  -F "submitter_email=bartender@test-restaurant.com"
```

**Expected Result:** JSON response with `submission_id` and validation details.

---

### Test 2: AI Review Process

Test the two-tier AI review system.

```bash
# Trigger AI review for a submission
curl -X POST http://localhost:3002/review \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "submission_id": "YOUR_SUBMISSION_ID",
    "original_path": "/path/to/original.docx",
    "submitter_email": "chef@test-restaurant.com"
  }'
```

**Expected Result:**
- Tier 1: General QA report
- Tier 2: Red-lined draft document
- Notification sent to internal reviewer

---

### Test 3: Dashboard Human Review

1. **Open Dashboard:**
   ```bash
   open http://localhost:3005
   ```

2. **View Pending Reviews:**
   - Should see all submissions with status `pending_human_review`
   - Each shows filename, submitter, submission date

3. **Review Individual Submission:**
   - Click "Review Now ‚Üí" button
   - Download original document
   - Download AI-generated draft (with red-lined corrections)

4. **Test Approval Flow:**
   - **Option A:** Click "Approve & Send to Chef" (AI draft is perfect)
   - **Option B:** Upload corrected version (you made additional changes)

---

### Test 4: Differ Service (AI Learning)

When you upload a corrected version, the system learns from your changes.

```bash
# Check learning statistics
curl http://localhost:3006/stats
```

**Expected Result:** Approval rate, common correction types, AI improvement metrics.

---

## üé¨ Demo Script for Stakeholders

### Setup (Before Meeting)
```bash
# 1. Start services
./start-services.sh

# 2. Create test data
./test-workflow.sh

# 3. Keep dashboard open
open http://localhost:3005
```

### Demo Flow

#### **Act 1: The Problem** (2 mins)
> "Currently, reviewing menu submissions is manual and time-consuming. Each menu needs to be checked against our SOP guidelines, which takes 30-45 minutes per submission. We process ~20 menus per month."

#### **Act 2: The Solution** (5 mins)

**Show Template Validation:**
```bash
# Live demo: Submit a menu
curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/validate \
  -F "document=@samples/example_pairs/RSH-Food-Template-v3.1.docx" \
  -F "submitter_email=demo-chef@restaurant.com" \
  -F "messageId=demo-$(date +%s)"
```
> "The system automatically validates that the document matches our approved RSH templates. Works for both food and beverage menus."

**Show AI Review Dashboard:**
- Navigate to http://localhost:3005
- Show the pending reviews list
- Click into a review
- Download and show the AI draft with corrections

> "The AI performs a two-tier review:
> - **Tier 1:** General QA - formatting, completeness, basic compliance
> - **Tier 2:** Red-lined draft - specific corrections based on SOP rules"

**Show Human Review:**
- Demonstrate the two options: Approve or Upload Corrected
- Explain the learning feedback loop

> "Human reviewers have final say. If they make additional corrections, the system learns and improves."

#### **Act 3: The Benefits** (2 mins)

**Time Savings:**
- AI review: 2-3 minutes
- Human verification: 5-10 minutes
- **Total: 85% time reduction**

**Consistency:**
- Every menu reviewed against same SOP rules
- No human oversight/fatigue

**Learning System:**
- Gets smarter with each human correction
- Accuracy improves over time

**Email Integration:**
- Once Azure permissions granted, fully automated
- Chefs email menu ‚Üí System processes ‚Üí Reviewer notified ‚Üí Approval ‚Üí Chef receives corrections

#### **Act 4: Next Steps** (1 min)

> "What we need to go live:
> 1. ‚úÖ System built and tested (DONE)
> 2. ‚è≥ Azure admin permissions (IN PROGRESS)
> 3. ‚è≥ OpenAI API key approval (IN PROGRESS)
> 4. üìÖ 1-week pilot with 2-3 reviewers
> 5. üìÖ Full rollout
>
> Estimated timeline: 2 weeks from Azure approval"

## üìä Key Metrics to Show

During testing, collect these metrics for your demo:

```bash
# Total submissions processed
curl -s http://localhost:3004/submissions | jq '. | length'

# Pending reviews
curl -s http://localhost:3004/submissions/pending | jq '. | length'

# AI accuracy (from differ service)
curl -s http://localhost:3006/stats | jq '.approvalRate'

# Average review time
# (Manual tracking during testing)
```

---

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Services Not Starting
```bash
# Check what's using the ports
lsof -i :3000,3001,3002,3003,3004,3005,3006

# Kill all node processes and restart
pkill -f "node"
./start-services.sh
```

### OpenAI API Errors
- Ensure `OPENAI_API_KEY` is set in `.env`
- Check API quota: https://platform.openai.com/usage
- For demo without OpenAI: Use mock AI responses (see `test-workflow.sh`)

### Template Not Recognized
- Ensure `.docx` files are in the correct format
- Check parser logs: `./view-logs.sh parser`
- Verify templates contain key phrases (see `BEVERAGE-SUPPORT.md`)

### Dashboard Not Loading
- Check browser console for errors
- Verify `dist/views/` folder contains `.ejs` files
- Rebuild dashboard: `cd services/dashboard && npm run build`
