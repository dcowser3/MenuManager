Please go to chatgpt.com. Upload your menu file Word Doc attachment with the copied/pasted following prompt into the search bar to check for errors: 
PROMPT FOR MENU REVIEW AND QUALITY ASSURANCE:
Review the attached menu and provide a detailed analysis identifying errors, inconsistencies, and potential improvements across the following categories to ensure 100% menu accuracy and professionalism:
1. DIETARY / ALLERGEN INFORMATION:

2. SPELLING, GRAMMAR, AND LANGUAGE CONSISTENCY:
ï Flag any spelling, punctuation, or grammatical errors in menu item names and descriptions.

    (e.g., accents, diacritical marks, capitalization rules, etc.).
ï Identify any inconsistencies in the style or tone of descriptions, such as changes between formal and informal language.
3. FORMATTING AND VISUAL CONSISTENCY:
ï Identify any inconsistencies in formatting, such as font styles, sizes, alignment, spacing, or bullet points.
ï Ensure all menu items and descriptions are consistently structured, including capitalization (e.g., dish names vs. descriptions), use of periods, pricing format, and placement of allergen/dietary markers).
ï Flag any categories or subcategories that lack uniform presentation or organization.
4. CLARITY AND READABILITY:
ï Highlight any descriptions that may be unclear, overly complex, or lacking detail.
ï Suggest improvements for descriptions that could better highlight ingredients, preparation methods, or flavor profiles to enhance guest understanding.
5. CULTURAL AND CONTEXTUAL APPROPRIATENESS:
ï Flag any potential cultural inaccuracies or insensitivities in the menu items or descriptions.
ï Ensure dish names and descriptions accurately reflect the cuisine’s cultural origins and avoid misrepresentation.

ï Menu Item: Clearly state the name of the menu item.
ï Description of Issue: Provide a clear and concise explanation of the problem.

FORMATTING

If the menu includes a wine program, we shall 
treat the categories as ways to group the wines - 
by region, by varietal, or by style.
Extensive and varied wine and spirit programs 
should be grouped by region.

the Glass should be grouped by style.
Very small or limited wine programs should be 
listed by varietal.

COMMON SPELLINGS
DEFINITIONS
We are careful to observe accent 
use where applicable to keep the 
menu authentically represented.
The following accents and spellings 
shall be implemented on all menus.
ACCENTS
AÇAÍ
AJÍ
ALBARIÑO
AÑEJO
CACHAÇA
CAMARÓN
CAFÉ
CHICHARRÓN
CHILE DE ÁRBOL
CÓCTELES
CRÈME BRÛLÉE

TAJÍN
TAMPIQUEÑA
All descriptors shall be in lower case, separated 
by commas, forward slashes, or dashes 
depending on design.
Descriptors of dish/drink names shall be in 
English, making sure to correct chile to chili, 
unless using a special chili with a Spanish name. 
Spanish menu versions can observe full Spanish 
descriptors.
Please also note that hyphenated words should 
only be used when an adjective is modifying a 
noun, and not used when combining 
ingredients. For instance, ‘sun-dried’ is an 
adjective and noun modifier, while 
‘peanut-guajillo’ is an ingredient combination. 
In this case, ‘peanut-guajillo’ would just be 
‘peanut guajillo’.
DESCRIPTIONS
Refraining from using redundant or 
unnecessary descriptors will allow for more 
real estate on the menu and ease in 
comprehension for the guest.
The reasoning behind eliminating words like 
juice, purée, and syrup, allows the ingredient 
to shine while assuming that the ingredient 
will be in liquid form in the cocktail. 
Announcing which liquid form each 
ingredient takes is unnecessary and lends a 
more premium quality to the item 
descriptor when this method is used.
The modifier ‘cheese’  shall be included on all 
menus. Cheeses of any variety including: 
Mozzarella, Manchego, Oaxaca, Mexican, 
Goat, Blue, Panela, Cotija, Brie, Pecorino, 
Parmesan, Cheddar, Swiss, etc should have 
‘cheese’ at the end.

When submitting your menu entries, please adhere to the 
following grammatical standards to maintain consistency 
across all our publications. Menu categories, such as 
'Desserts' and 'Wines', should always be labeled in the 
plural form. This helps to indicate the variety and selection 
available within each category.
SINGULAR VS. PLURAL
MENU CATEGORIES - PLURAL
Conversely, when listing ingredients that accompany a menu item, 
descriptions should be singular to emphasize the individual quality 
and uniqueness of each component. For example, list 'cherry tomato, 
almond, arugula' rather than 'cherry tomatoes, almonds, arugula'.
EXCEPTIONS: 
1. Beans
2. Chips
3. Greens
4. Berries
5. Fries
6. Seeds
7. Herbs
8. Noodles
9. Sprouts
10. Diced Vegetables 
11. Mixed Cheeses
12. Mixed Mushrooms
These ingredients should always be listed in the plural, regardless of the 
context. These terms naturally imply a plurality that enhances the 
description of the dishes.
Please ensure your menu submissions comply with these guidelines 
to ensure clarity and uniformity throughout our menu presentations.
MENU INGREDIENT DESCRIPTIONS - SINGULAR
Notations shall exist on dish/drink name line, in 
superscript, separated by commas and no spaces.
Double check menu to make sure allergens aren’t 
missed - ice cream has dairy, butters and oyster 
sauces contain allergens and will be rejected.
For menu items that contain multiple allergens, 
ALLERGENS SHOULD BE LISTED IN 
ALPHEBETICAL ORDER.
Dietary notes shall be listed at the bottom of the 
menu on culinary pages. We do not list gluten 
free, nut free, dairy free, shellfish free items, only 
noting which dishes DO contain an allergen. 
A discussion with a server or chef and
the guest can determine gluten free items, and 
also helps guest to engage with staff.
NOTE: Allergens are region specific and we abide 
by all local laws regarding allergen disclosure. 
Please be sure your allergen submission is clearly 
communicated on the brief and that its observing 
all local laws.

In the case of two prices listed, ex. glass price and bottle 
price, a vertical bar ( | ) shall be used to separate.
Prices can exist spaced two spaces from the dish/drink
name, or tabbed out to line up with all prices in a column, and 
depending on menu design, the established convention of the 
menu should be followed for all prices.
