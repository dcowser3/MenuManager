## RSH MENU GUIDELINES - COMPREHENSIVE RULES

### 1. FORMATTING RULES

#### 1.1 Dish/Drink Names
- Font: Calibri (Body), 12pt, Bold
- Case: Sentence Case (capitalize first word and proper nouns only)
- NO ALL CAPS except approved acronyms: RSH, TT
- Conjunctions in middle of names should be lowercase: "Salt or Spicy" (NOT "Salt Or Spicy"), "Sushi and Sashimi"

#### 1.2 Descriptions
- Font: Calibri (Body), 12pt
- Case: ALWAYS lowercase
- Descriptors separated by commas, forward slashes, or dashes depending on design

**Do NOT capitalize these words even at start of line:**
- australian, roasted, grilled, seared, shaved, stuffed, chilean, serrano, mezcal
- braised, smoked, fried, baked, steamed, poached, charred, pickled
- candied, whipped, toasted, infused

**Grammar in dish names:**
- Use "choice of" not "choice" before options: "choice of chicken or vegetables"

#### 1.3 Prices
- Format: Whole numbers only
- NO: Dollar signs ($), cents (.00), "USD"
- Dual prices: Use vertical bar ` | ` to separate (e.g., "11 | 40" for glass/bottle)
- Prix fixe: Use 00.00PP format

#### 1.3.1 Missing Price Detection (CRITICAL)
Every dish on a standard (non-prix-fixe) menu MUST have a price. If a dish entry has a name and description but no price, flag it as a suggestion with:
- type: "Missing Price"
- severity: "critical"
- Do NOT auto-correct missing prices in the corrected menu — leave them in SUGGESTIONS only
- For prix fixe menus, individual dishes do NOT need prices (only the overall prix fixe price is required). Do NOT flag missing individual dish prices on prix fixe menus.

#### 1.3.2 Incomplete/Missing Dish Names (CRITICAL)
Every menu entry must have a recognizable dish name. Flag entries that are:
- Just a description without a dish name (e.g., "grilled, served with salsa 24")
- Just a price with no dish name
- Partial or truncated names that appear incomplete

Flag these as a suggestion with:
- type: "Incomplete Dish Name"
- severity: "critical"
- Do NOT auto-correct — leave in SUGGESTIONS only

#### 1.4 Allergens
- Format: Superscript, same line as dish/drink name

### 5. DESCRIPTIONS

#### 5.1 Hyphenation Rules

**USE hyphens for compound adjective modifiers (adjective + past participle):**
- sun-dried (tomato)
- house-made
- wood-fired
- dashi-braised (bok choy)
- adobo-marinated
- karaage-style
- Stir-Fried (Wagyu Beef)
- Singaporean-style
- Corn-Fed (Chicken)
- 24-Hour Braised (Short Ribs) - time-based compounds use hyphens

**USE hyphens for compound cooking methods:**
- stir-fried
- pan-seared
- slow-roasted

**USE hyphens for compound flavor modifiers before nouns:**
- miso-guajillo (marinade)
- miso-chipotle (sauce)
- yuzu-chipotle (dressing)
- lime-chili (dressing)

**DO NOT use hyphens for ingredient combinations:**
- peanut guajillo (NOT peanut-guajillo)
- mango chipotle (NOT mango-chipotle)
- lime cilantro (NOT lime-cilantro)
- guajillo macha (NOT guajillo-macha) - Exception: if part of a sauce name like "guajillo–macha sauce"

#### 5.2 Redundant Words to AVOID (Flag as Suggestions)

**Food descriptions - remove these:**
- creamy, warm, fresh
- pepper (unless specifying type)
- garnish, mesclun

**Drink descriptions - remove these:**
- juice (just say "lime" not "lime juice")
- puree (just say "mango" not "mango puree")
- syrup (just say "agave" not "agave syrup")
- vodka, tequila, rum, gin, bourbon, whiskey (assume liquid form in cocktail)

#### 5.3 Cheese Rule
Always include "cheese" modifier:
- mozzarella cheese, Manchego cheese (NOT just "mozzarella, manchego")
- Applies to: Mozzarella, Manchego, Oaxaca, Mexican, Goat, Blue, Panela, Cotija, Brie, Pecorino, Parmesan, Cheddar, Swiss, Provolone, etc.
- Note: Manchego should always be capitalized

#### 5.4 Dish Name Consistency
When a dish name includes both protein and preparation method, the preparation/style typically comes first:
- "Miso Salmon" (NOT "Salmon Miso") - the miso preparation modifies the salmon
- "Grilled Octopus" (NOT "Octopus Grilled")
- Exception: When the protein IS the dish name, keep it first: "Salmon, achiote ponzu..."

---

### 6. SINGULAR VS. PLURAL

#### 6.1 Categories & Section Headers = PLURAL
- Desserts (not Dessert)
- Wines (not Wine)
- Appetizers (not Appetizer)

These ingredients are ALWAYS plural:

- Diced Vegetables, Mixed Cheeses, Mixed Mushrooms

---

### 7. ALLERGENS

#### 7.1 Dynamic Allergen Detection

**IMPORTANT**: Each menu document may have its own allergen key/legend. You MUST:
1. First, look for an allergen key or legend in the document (usually at the bottom of the menu)
2. Use the codes and definitions provided in THAT document
3. Apply those specific codes when reviewing menu items

**Common allergen key formats:**
```
C crustaceans | CE celery | D dairy | E egg | F fish | G gluten | L lupin | MO mollusc | MU mustard | N nuts | P peanut | SE sesame | S soya | SU sulphites | V vegetarian | VG vegan
```
or simpler versions like:
```
D dairy | G gluten | N nuts | S shellfish | V vegetarian | VG vegan
```

#### 7.2 Formatting
- Comma-separated, NO spaces
- ALPHABETICAL order (preferred but not always enforced - flag as suggestion)
- Example: `Dish Name D,G,N 18`

#### 7.3 Ingredient-to-Allergen Mapping

Use this knowledge to identify missing allergen codes based on the document's allergen key:

**DAIRY / D**
- Milk, cream, butter, cheese, yogurt, ice cream, crème fraîche

**EGG / E**
- Eggs, mayonnaise, aioli, hollandaise, béarnaise, meringue, custard

**FISH / F** (NOT shellfish or crustaceans - do not use S or C for fish!)
- Salmon, tuna, cod, anchovy, branzino, sea bass, seabass, swordfish, hamachi, sake (salmon sashimi), maguro, suzuki, sea bream
- Fish sauce, Worcestershire sauce, bonito flakes, dashi, furikake
- IMPORTANT: Branzino, sea bass, seabass, sea bream, and other whole fish are FISH (F), NOT shellfish (S) or crustaceans (C)

**CRUSTACEANS / C** (shelled creatures with legs)
- Shrimp, prawns, lobster, crab, crawfish, langoustine, kani (crab)
- NOT the same as molluscs!

**MOLLUSC / MO** (soft-bodied, often in shells or no shells)
- Squid, octopus, calamari, clams, mussels, oysters, scallops, snails, abalone, urchin
- IMPORTANT: Calamari and octopus are MOLLUSCS (MO), not crustaceans (C)

**GLUTEN / G**
- Wheat, bread, tortilla (flour), pita, naan, pasta, beer, soy sauce, fried food (breaded), pie crust, roux

**NUTS / N** (tree nuts)
- Almond, brazil nut, cashew, hazelnut, macadamia, pecan, pine nut, pistachio, walnut
- Also: pesto, salsa macha, praline, marzipan
- Note: Write "cashew" not "cashew nut" (redundant)

**PEANUT / P** (separate from tree nuts - CRITICAL distinction!)
- Peanuts, peanut butter, peanut oil, satay sauce
- IMPORTANT: If a dish contains peanuts, it needs BOTH P and N allergens
- Example: "Papaya Pomelo Salad, green mango, peanut, lime chili dressing P,N,VG"
- Peanuts are legumes, not tree nuts, but often listed with both codes for safety

**SESAME / SE**
- Sesame seeds, tahini, hummus, sesame oil

**SOYA / S**
- Soy sauce, tofu, tempeh, edamame, miso

**CELERY / CE**
- Celery, celeriac, celery salt

**MUSTARD / MU**
- Mustard, mustard seeds, mustard powder

**SULPHITES / SU**
- Wine, dried fruits, pickled foods

**LUPIN / L**
- Lupin flour, lupin seeds (common in European baking)

**VEGETARIAN / V** (flag if dish contains)
- Meat, poultry, fish, seafood, gelatin, rennet cheese, lard, chicken/beef broth

**VEGAN / VG** (flag if dish contains)
- Any animal products: meat, fish, dairy, eggs, honey
- IMPORTANT: Ice cream, cream, butter, cheese = DAIRY = NOT VEGAN
- If dish has dairy, use V (vegetarian) NOT VG (vegan)

### 8. RAW/UNDERCOOKED ITEMS (*)

#### 8.1 When to Apply Asterisk

**SEAFOOD**
- Oysters on the Half Shell, Sushi & Sashimi, Ceviche, Crudo, Poke, Tiradito
- Raw tuna, salmon tartare, hamachi, any raw fish preparation
- Chef's Sushi Selection, Sashimi platters
- Dishes with tobiko (fish roe) - often raw
- Fish/prawn gyoza may need * if fish is undercooked
- Crispy Rice Salmon (if salmon tartare on top)
- Sushi rolls with raw fish (Spicy Salmon, Shrimp Roll if raw components)

**MEAT & POULTRY**
- Steak Tartare, Carpaccio, Beef Tataki
- Rare or Medium-Rare Steak, Wagyu filet, Wagyu rib eye (typically served undercooked)
- Duck Breast (Seared, Medium-Rare)

**EGGS**
- Hollandaise & Bearnaise Sauces, Caesar Dressing (Traditional)
- Sunny-Side-Up or Over-Easy Eggs, Fried & Soft-Boiled Eggs, Tiramisu
- Any dish with "sunny side-up egg" needs * (runny yolk = undercooked)
- Cured egg yolk - needs * (curing does not fully cook)

**OTHER**
- Cheeses Made with Raw Milk
- Meringue (Uncooked or Lightly Cooked)
- Certain Cocktails (e.g., Whiskey Sour with egg white)

#### 8.2 Asterisk Placement Rules (CRITICAL)

The asterisk (*) must be placed AFTER the last word of the description, BEFORE the allergen codes and price.

**Correct placement patterns:**
```
Dish Name, description* ALLERGENS PRICE
Dish Name, description * ALLERGENS PRICE
Dish Name* ALLERGENS PRICE
```

**Examples:**
- `First Kiss, yellowfin tuna, leche de tigre, ají amarillo, truffle oil, root chips, furikake* 24`
- `Toro Love & Fire, 6oz Australian Wagyu filet mignon, jumbo prawns, guajillo–macha sauce* D,S 85`
- `Angry Zengo, spicy tuna, avocado, lemon, yuzu kosho aioli * E,F,SE 78`
- `Sashimi *F` (for sashimi items, asterisk goes before allergen)
- `Chef's Selection Sushi and Tiradito *F`

**Key rules:**
1. Asterisk goes at END of description, not after dish name
2. Space before asterisk is acceptable: `description *` or `description*`
3. For items with only allergens (no description), asterisk goes before allergens: `Sashimi *F`
4. Sushi/sashimi items need both * AND appropriate fish allergen (F)

#### 8.3 Required Footer
Culinary pages MUST include:
`*CONSUMING RAW OR UNDERCOOKED MEATS, POULTRY, SEAFOOD, OR EGGS MAY INCREASE YOUR RISK OF FOODBORNE ILLNESS`

## REVIEW CHECKLIST

When reviewing menu text:

1. **Check spelling** against vocabulary rules (Section 3) - HIGH CONFIDENCE
2. **Apply accents** to all words that need them (Section 4) - HIGH CONFIDENCE
3. **Validate allergen codes** are present, alphabetized, and correctly formatted (Section 7) - HIGH CONFIDENCE
4. **Flag raw/undercooked items** missing asterisks (Section 8) - HIGH CONFIDENCE
5. **Check plural/singular** usage (Section 6) - MEDIUM CONFIDENCE
6. **Flag redundant words** (Section 5.2) - MEDIUM CONFIDENCE
7. **Fix hyphenation** per rules (Section 5.1) - MEDIUM CONFIDENCE
8. **Flag duplicate menu items** - if same dish appears twice, flag for review - MEDIUM CONFIDENCE
9. **Suggest "cheese" modifier** where missing (Section 5.3) - LOW CONFIDENCE
10. **Validate pricing**: Every dish must have a price (unless prix fixe) - CRITICAL SEVERITY, type "Missing Price"
11. **Check category names** for proper pluralization (Section 2) - LOW CONFIDENCE
12. **Validate dish names**: Every entry must have a recognizable dish name - CRITICAL SEVERITY, type "Incomplete Dish Name"

**When uncertain**: Flag for human review rather than making incorrect changes.

**Pattern inference**: These rules are examples. Apply similar logic to unlisted items:
- If "Jalapeno" needs an accent, so do other Spanish words with n
- If "Mozzarella" is misspelled as "Mozarella", similar double-letter errors should be caught
- If "passion fruit" is two words, apply similar logic to compound food terms

---

## IMPORTANT GUIDELINES:

- Be aggressive with high-confidence corrections (spelling, accents, typos, obvious errors)
- Only include medium/low confidence items in the SUGGESTIONS section
- ALWAYS return the corrected menu between the markers, even if no changes were made
- Format suggestions as valid JSON array
- Keep descriptions concise and actionable
- The "severity" field is REQUIRED on every suggestion. Default to "normal" for most issues.
- "Missing Price" suggestions MUST always have severity "critical"
- "Incomplete Dish Name" suggestions MUST always have severity "critical"
- All other suggestion types should have severity "normal" unless they represent a truly critical issue
