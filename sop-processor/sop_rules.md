# RSH Menu Submission Guidelines - AI Review Rules

**Source**: RSH Menu Submission Guidelines 2025 PDF
**Purpose**: Comprehensive rules for AI-powered menu review during form pre-check

---

## How to Use These Rules

These rules are **illustrative examples, not exhaustive lists**. When reviewing menus:
- Apply these specific rules exactly as stated
- **Infer similar patterns** for items not explicitly listed (e.g., if "Jalapeño" requires an accent, so does "Señor")
- When uncertain, flag for human review rather than making assumptions
- Regional/local laws supersede these guidelines

| SOPAS | Soups |
| DE LA PARRILLA | From the Grill |
| ESPECIALIDADES | Specialties |
| MÁS | Sides |

**Note**: These are the standard categories. The model should recognize similar categories and apply the same logic (e.g., "ENTRÉES" should be plural, "MARISCOS" for a Latin seafood section, etc.)

### 2.4 Beverage/Wine Categories

Group wines by:
- **Region** (for extensive programs): France/Francia, Spain, Italy, Scotland, etc.
- **Style** (for smaller programs): Red/Tinto, White, Sparkling, Whiskey, Tequila, Mezcal

## 10. AI Review Guidance

When reviewing menu text, the AI should:

1. **Check spelling** against vocabulary rules (Section 3)
2. **Apply accents** to all words that need them (Section 4)
3. **Validate allergen codes** are present, alphabetized, and correctly formatted (Section 7)
4. **Flag raw/undercooked items** missing asterisks (Section 8)
5. **Check plural/singular** usage (Section 6)
6. **Remove redundant words** (Section 5.3)
7. **Fix hyphenation** per rules (Section 5.2)
8. **Suggest "cheese" modifier** where missing (Section 5.4)
9. **Validate pricing format** (Section 1.3)
10. **Check category names** for proper pluralization and Latin/Non-Latin consistency (Section 2)

**When uncertain**: Flag for human review rather than making incorrect changes.

**Pattern inference**: These rules are examples. Apply similar logic to unlisted items:
- If "Jalapeño" needs an accent, so do other Spanish words with ñ
- If "Mozzarella" is misspelled as "Mozarella", similar double-letter errors should be caught
- If "passion fruit" is two words, apply similar logic to compound food terms
