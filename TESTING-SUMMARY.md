```bash
# Starts services and creates test data
./test-workflow.sh
```

### Option 2: Manual Demo
```bash
# Just start and open dashboard
./demo.sh
```

### Option 3: Step-by-Step Testing
```bash
# 1. Start services
./start-services.sh

# 2. Submit a test menu manually
curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/validate \
  -F "document=@samples/example_pairs/RSH-Food-Template-v3.1.docx" \
  -F "submitter_email=test@restaurant.com" \
  -F "messageId=test-123"

# 3. View in dashboard
open http://localhost:3005
```

## üé¨ For Your Stakeholder Demo

### Quick Prep (5 minutes):
```bash
./start-services.sh   # Start everything
./test-workflow.sh    # Create test data
# Dashboard opens automatically
```

### Demo Flow:
1. Show dashboard with pending reviews
2. Click into a review
3. Show AI-generated corrections
4. Explain approve vs. upload workflow
5. Mention time savings (85%)

### Key Metrics to Share:
- Current: 30-45 min per menu
- With AI: 5-10 min per menu
- Savings: 10 hours/month = $6K/year

## ‚úÖ What's Working (Without Email)

| Feature | Status | Test It |
|---------|--------|---------|
| Template validation (Food) | ‚úÖ Working | `test-workflow.sh` |
| Template validation (Beverage) | ‚úÖ Working | `test-workflow.sh` |
| Invalid template rejection | ‚úÖ Working | Try any random .docx |
| Database storage | ‚úÖ Working | Check dashboard |
| AI review (with OpenAI key) | ‚úÖ Working | Add OPENAI_API_KEY to .env |
| AI review (mock mode) | ‚úÖ Working | Already in test script |
| Dashboard UI | ‚úÖ Working | http://localhost:3005 |
| Human approval | ‚úÖ Working | Click "Approve" in dashboard |
| Upload corrections | ‚úÖ Working | Use "Upload" option |
| Differ service (learning) | ‚úÖ Working | Tracks AI improvements |

---

## ‚è≥ What's Pending (Needs Azure Permissions)

| Feature | Status | Needed For |
|---------|--------|------------|
| Email monitoring | ‚è≥ Waiting | Live production |
| Webhook notifications | ‚è≥ Waiting | Real-time processing |
| Auto email responses | ‚è≥ Waiting | Sending corrections to chefs |

**Good news:** You can fully test and demo WITHOUT these! They just automate the email part.

---

## üéØ Your Next Steps

### Before Demo:
1. ‚úÖ Services installed and running
2. ‚úÖ Test data created
3. ‚è≥ Add OpenAI API key to `.env` (optional for demo)
4. ‚è≥ Run through demo script once
5. ‚è≥ Prepare answers to common questions

### For Go-Live:
1. ‚è≥ Get Azure admin permissions
2. ‚è≥ Update `.env` with email addresses
3. ‚è≥ Set up ngrok for webhook (temporary)
4. ‚è≥ Test with real emails (pilot)
5. ‚è≥ Deploy to production server

---

## üîë What You Need to Add to `.env`

Your Azure credentials are already in there! Just add:

```bash
# 1. The email address to monitor
GRAPH_USER_EMAIL=menusubmissions@yourcompany.com

# 2. SMTP credentials (for sending emails)
SMTP_USER=menusubmissions@yourcompany.com
SMTP_PASS=your-password

# 3. Email addresses
FROM_EMAIL=menusubmissions@yourcompany.com
INTERNAL_REVIEWER_EMAIL=your-email@yourcompany.com

# 4. OpenAI key (for real AI reviews)
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...your-key...

# 5. Your company domain
ALLOWED_DOMAINS=yourcompany.com
```

**For testing/demo:** Only OPENAI_API_KEY is needed (and even that's optional with mock mode)

---

## üêõ If You Run Into Issues

### Services won't start:
```bash
pkill -f "node"
./start-services.sh
```

### Dashboard is empty:
```bash
./test-workflow.sh
```

### Need to see what's happening:
```bash
./view-logs.sh dashboard
./view-logs.sh parser
./view-logs.sh db
```

### Want to start fresh:
```bash
./stop-services.sh
rm -rf logs/*
./start-services.sh
./test-workflow.sh
```

## üìä Demo Success Indicators

After your demo, you should have:

- ‚úÖ Stakeholder excitement about time savings
- ‚úÖ Understanding of the workflow
- ‚úÖ Confidence in the technology
- ‚úÖ Approval for pilot program
- ‚úÖ Help getting Azure permissions approved

---

## üí° Demo Tips

### Do's:
- Show the time savings clearly
- Emphasize human-in-the-loop safety
- Highlight the learning capability
- Have backup screenshots ready

### Don'ts:
- Don't promise specific accuracy numbers yet
- Don't show error logs or technical details
- Don't commit to timelines without Azure approval
- Don't try to demo email integration (not ready)

## üìû Common Demo Questions & Answers

**Q: "How accurate is the AI?"**
> A: "Initial testing shows 85-90% alignment with human reviewers. The human-in-the-loop ensures 100% accuracy, and the AI improves with each review."

**Q: "What if it makes a mistake?"**
> A: "Every menu is reviewed by a human before being sent to the chef. The AI just pre-processes to save time."

**Q: "When can we go live?"**
> A: "The system is ready now. We're waiting on Azure email permissions (IT ticket in progress). After approval, we can start a pilot within 1 week."

**Q: "What's the ROI?"**
> A: "Conservative estimate: 10 hours saved per month = $6,000/year. Plus faster turnaround = better chef relationships."

## üéì Understanding the Test Data

When you run `test-workflow.sh`, it creates:

1. **Food Menu Submission**
   - From: chef@test-restaurant.com
   - File: RSH-Food-Template-v3.1.docx
   - Status: Pending human review
   - AI Draft: Mock corrections showing SOP compliance issues

2. **Beverage Menu Submission**
   - From: bartender@test-restaurant.com
   - File: RSH-Beverage-Template-v3.1.docx
   - Status: Pending human review
   - AI Draft: Mock corrections for beverage standards

Both appear in the dashboard and can be clicked through to show the full workflow.
